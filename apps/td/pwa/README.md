Competitive multiplayer Tower Defense game. Combines RNG shop mechanics (auto-battler style), dynamic pathing with free tower placement, and unit-sending PvP (old school Warcraft TD). Players build, defend, and attack in a real-time loop with evolving income. High replayability and skill-based late game.
